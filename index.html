    <h3>Bios</h3>

    <p>I've been taking band for two years now, going on my third. I play only the best instrument in the band, the bassoon. I have extensive experience in the art of bassooning, but right now it's in the shop. Somebody also stole my last reed so I can't play it anyways. We recently had our concert and it was fun. I just wish some people would put a little bit more time into their practice. Some people also need to just be quiet, it makes it hard to learn when they won't stop talking or playing.</p>
    <p>My favorite activity to pass time is to hang with people. I also work at this prestigious amusement park called Lagoon. I like working there because I can earn money, while hanging out in the fridge. It's cool in there, and I don't have to do anything. The supervisors are pretty chill. It's not that strict, and you get the opportunity to earn a little money.</p>
